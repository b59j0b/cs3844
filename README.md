COMM 3500 – Winter 2025 
Midterm   (Excel   Part) – 25 Marks
The European Bakery in the Halifax area bakes   80   trays of   its   famous   “borek”,   a well-known   savory   pastry in the owner’s homeland, at the beginning of   each day. Using the historical   data, the   owner believes that daily demand will follow the distribution shown   in the   following   table:
Daily Demand 
Probability 
10 
0.05 
30 
0.1 
50 
0.1 
70 
0.25 
90 
0.2 
110 
0.2 
130 
0.1 
Each tray costs the European Bakery $25 and   can be   sold   for   $50. Any   unsold   trays   can   be   salvaged/donated for $5   at   the   end   of   the   day.
The (daily) fixed cost has two components. The   first   component   is known   for   certainty:   the rent,   insurance,   and employee salaries add to $400 per day (daily   conversion   of   $10,000 per month).   The   second component is uncertain and estimated using a continuous uniform. distribution with   lower bound   $a   and upper bound $b. This includes maintenance (e.g., due to weather conditions),   energy usage,   shipping,   etc.,   converted as daily   expenses. 
You   will   determine   a   and   busing   the   last   2 digits   of   your   Banner   ID.   Set   the   smaller   value   times   100   as   a and larger one times   100 as b. If   they are   equal,   deduct   1   from   adigit before   multiplying   it   with   100.   If there is a 0 in the last two   digits   or you   get   0   after   deducting   1, take   a    =    100   and calculate b   accordingly. If   they are both 0 or a digit is   0   and the   other   is   1,   use   a    =    100   and b    =   200. Example: B01234567 yields a   =   600   and b   =   700. Example 2: B01234599 yields a    =   800   and b    =   900. Example 3: Both   B01234500 and B01234501 yield a    =    100   and b   =   200. 
A. Open a new Excel workbook. In cell A1, type your first and lastname.   In   cell   A2,   type   your Banner ID and   finally, in   cell   A3, type   your Dalemail. Make   them   in bold font in   size   16.   If   any   of   these items are missing or incorrect, you will receive a mark of zero for the Excel   file!
B. Change the name of   the worksheet as ‘BE_analysis   ’.   Copy   the   worksheet   or   create   another   one   and   change its name to ‘Simulation   ’. Both worksheets must contain the information in A. in the requested   format.
C. Please note that you will be marked based on the formatting in your   spreadsheets too.   Your   values   and plots must be neat and readable; and you must use   frames and highlight   cells with   a   formula, change decimals and/or format, etc. as in the   Excel   files we use   in   lectures/labs.
D. Answer the questions below.   Save your Excel file using filename: Last Name_First Name_Banner ID and place the file in the dropbox: Brightspace>Assessments>Assignments>Midterm (Excel Part). 
E. Important: It is recommended that the   students   first   save the   file to   a   safe place with the   desired name   and then, keep saving it frequently throughout the exam to   avoid 代 写COMM 3500 – Winter 2025 MidtermR
代做程序编程语言  any unforeseen   events   that   may result in crushing of   the exam file. It   is   student's responsibility   to upload   a working   Excel   file.   Perform. the following tasks:
1. Expected values and B-E analysis (3 Marks):
a. Enter the necessary data into ‘BEanalysis   ’   worksheet. Find the expected demand   and   expected fixed cost. (1.5 Marks) 
b. Find break-even point using the mean fixed cost. Is it attainable   for the   given   information,   why or why not? Comment using bold red font. (1.5 Marks) 
2. Simulation (Part 1) (10 Marks):
Simulate   1 month (25 workdays) of   operation to calculate the bakery’s total monthly profit.   Your worksheet must have the following four areas:
I. The table of   demand probability distribution (including the corresponding cumulative   probability).
II. Input data area that neatly displays the information provided in   the   question   including   the   probability   distribution   of   the   fixed   cost.
III. Simulation area that neatly shows 25 replications to   calculate   daily profit   for   25 days.
IV. Analysis area that shows the total monthly profit.
3. Simulation (Part 2) (7 Marks):
a. Replicate this calculation   1000 times and compute the average total monthly profit.   (3 Marks)
b. Create a summary statistics part and the histogram of   the monthly profit.   Comment using bold red font.   (3 Marks)
c. Calculate   the   probability   of   making   more   than   $x   profit   per   month. You   determine   $x   according to the upper bound of   the uncertain fixed cost (1 Mark):
$X 
UB 
$28,000 
UB ≤ 200 
$25,000 
200 < UB ≤ 400 
$20,000 
400 < UB ≤ 600 
$15,000 
600 < UB ≤ 800 
$10,000 
UB > 800 
4. Scenario Manager (3 Marks):
The European Bakery would like to investigate the profitability of   baking   60,   80,   100, or   120 trays   at the start of   the day. Create a table using   Scenario Manager   (don’t   forget   to   replace   cell   addresses   in the table with the labels). Which quantity would you recommend? Why? Comment using bold red   font.
Accurate data entry and general   formatting (2 marks) 
Late Submission Penalties: This assignment should take   around   30 mins   and you   are   allocated   24   hours   to complete it. My advice   for you is to have at   least   a   10-15 mins   buffer before the   due   date/time   for   submitting   your Excel file as it is worth 25% of   the   Final.   If   you think you   have   a   connectivity   issue   or   some   other problem that may cause a delay, I recommend submitting the   file   even   earlier.   For   late   submissions, we have   apenalty policy: 
<30 mins 
10% 
>30 mins but <1hr 
20% 
>1hr but <2hr 
40% 
<2hr but >3hr 
80% 
>3hr 
Submissions not acceptable 
Files   sent   via e-mail will   receive no marks and there will be no exceptions.   Lastly, there   is   a 10% penalty in   case   the   Excel   file   doesn’t   include   the   necessary   details   (name,   Banner   ID,   etc.).
